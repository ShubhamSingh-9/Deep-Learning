# Building a Word Prediction Model for FAQs Using TensorFlow and Keras.


## Introduction:

Word prediction models are based on the idea of predicting the next word in a sequence of words given some context. For example, given the sentence "She loves to play", a word prediction model might suggest "soccer", "piano", or "games" as possible next words. To build such a model, we need to train it on a large corpus of text data and learn the statistical patterns of word usage and co-occurrence. In this blog post, we'll use the TensorFlow framework and the Keras library to implement a simple word prediction model using a recurrent neural network (RNN). We'll also evaluate the performance of our model on a test set and see how it compares to other models.

## Understanding the Code:

Before we dive into the technical aspects of the code, let's take a look at the dataset we're working with. The dataset consists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to a Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP 2023). Our goal is to create a model that can predict the next word in a sentence, given a seed word or phrase.

To achieve this, we will use long short-term memory (LSTM). LSTM is a special kind of RNN unit that can learn long-term dependencies and avoid the problem of vanishing gradients.

The code is divided into four main parts:

1. Data preprocessing: We load the dataset, tokenize the sentences, split it into train and test sets, and pad them to a fixed length.
2. Model building: We define the model with an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer with softmax.
3. Model training: We compile the model, specify the loss function and optimizer, and fit the model to the training data for several epochs.
4. Model evaluation: We generate predictions on the test data, calculate the perplexity score, and visualize some sample outputs.

## Tokenization and Data Preparation:

To start, we use the TensorFlow library to tokenize the text. Tokenization is the process of converting words into numerical values, which the model can understand. Each word is assigned a unique number, creating a word index. The code snippet below shows how tokenization is performed:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([faqs])
```
## Creating the Dataset:

The heart of our word prediction model is the dataset. The dataset consists of text that we divided into sentences and converted into numerical sequences. Each sequence represents a sentence where each number corresponds to a word. To train our model, we created input sequences and output sequences from the dataset. The input sequences are the first part of a sentence, and the output sequences are the word that comes after the input sequence in the sentence. This way, our model can learn and generate words based on the sentence context.

## Data Padding:

One of the challenges of working with text data is that the sentences can have different numbers of words. This can cause problems for our model, which expects a fixed input size. To solve this, we use a technique called padding, which adds zeros to the start of the input sequences until they reach a certain length. This length is determined by the longest sentence in our dataset. The Padding ensures that all inputs have the same shape and can be processed by our model.

## Building the Model:

Our model is based on three main components: an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer. Let's see what each component does and how they contribute to the word prediction task.

The embedding layer is responsible for transforming the tokenized input into dense vectors. This means that each word in the input is mapped to a high-dimensional vector that represents its semantic and syntactic features. The embedding layer makes the input more suitable for deep learning, as it reduces the sparsity and dimensionality of the data.

The LSTM layer is a type of recurrent neural network that can process sequential data. The LSTM layer can learn the long-term dependencies and context of the words in the input. It also maintains a hidden state that stores the information from previous words. The LSTM layer outputs a vector for each word in the input, which captures its meaning and position in the sequence.

The dense layer is the final component of our model. It takes the output of the LSTM layer and applies a softmax activation function to it. The softmax function converts the vector into a probability distribution over the vocabulary. The dense layer predicts the next word in the sequence by choosing the word with the highest probability.

## Training and Fine-Tuning:

The model is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an embedding layer and a softmax output layer. The RNN learns the sequential patterns in the text data and the embedding layer converts the words into numerical vectors. The softmax output layer assigns a probability to each word in the vocabulary as the next word.

To measure how well the model performs, we use a loss function called categorical cross-entropy. This loss function compares the predicted probabilities with the actual next words and penalizes the model for making wrong predictions. The lower the loss, the better the model.

To update the model's parameters, we use an optimization algorithm called Adam. This algorithm adjusts the learning rate dynamically based on the gradient of the loss function. The learning rate determines how much the model changes its parameters in each iteration.

We train the model by feeding it batches of text data and computing the loss and the gradient for each batch. We repeat this process for several rounds, called epochs, until the model converges to a minimum loss. This way, we fine-tune the model's weights to optimize its word prediction accuracy.

## Results and Predictions:

We start with a seed word (for example, "nlp"), and we ask the model to predict the next word based on the previous words in the sentence. We repeat this process until we have a complete sentence, and we observe how the model's predictions become more accurate and coherent as it learns from the context. This is a way to measure the model's ability to capture the semantics and syntax of natural language.

## Conclusion:

We've explored the process of creating a word prediction model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes a seed word or phrase and predicts the next word based on the context of the input. This technology has numerous applications, from auto-suggest features to chatbots and more.

As the field of natural language processing continues to evolve, word prediction models like the one we've built here play a crucial role in improving user experiences and automating various aspects of language understanding. Whether you're a developer or a data scientist, understanding the mechanics of such models can be a valuable skill in your toolkit.

Feel free to experiment with the code and datasets to build your own word prediction models for different applications. The possibilities are endless, and the world of natural language processing is full of exciting challenges and opportunities.
