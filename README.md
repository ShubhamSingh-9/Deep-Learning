# Building a Word Prediction Model for FAQs Using TensorFlow and Keras.


## Introduction:

In the world of natural language processing, building a word prediction model can be a fascinating endeavor. Such models are not only used in various applications like auto-suggest features in search engines but also in chatbots and customer support systems. In this blog post, we'll explore the creation of a word prediction model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Understanding the Code:

Before we dive into the technical aspects of the code, let's take a look at the dataset we're working with. The dataset consists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to a Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP 2023). Our goal is to create a model that can predict the next word in a sentence, given a seed word or phrase.

## Tokenization and Data Preparation:

To start, we use the TensorFlow library to tokenize the text. Tokenization is the process of converting words into numerical values, which the model can understand. Each word is assigned a unique number, creating a word index. The code snippet below shows how tokenization is performed:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts([faqs])
```
##Creating the Dataset:

The heart of our word prediction model is the dataset. We split the text into sentences and tokenize each sentence into a sequence of numbers. We then create input sequences and corresponding output sequences. For each input sequence, the output sequence consists of the next word in the sentence. This dataset allows our model to learn and predict words based on the context of the sentence.

##Data Padding:

Since sentences in the FAQs have varying lengths, we need to ensure that all inputs to our model are of the same length. To achieve this, we pad the input sequences with zeros. The maximum length of any sequence in our dataset determines the length of padding.

##Building the Model:

Our word prediction model consists of three key components: an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer. The embedding layer converts the tokenized input into dense vectors, making it suitable for deep learning. The LSTM layer, a type of recurrent neural network, helps the model understand the sequence of words and their context. Finally, the dense layer with a softmax activation function predicts the next word in the sequence.

##Training and Fine-Tuning:

To train our model, we use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. We iterate through the dataset over several epochs, fine-tuning the model's weights to optimize word prediction accuracy.

##Results and Predictions:

After training the model, it's time to put it to the test. We provide an initial word (in this case, "nlp"), and the model predicts the next word based on the context of the sentence. We iterate this process to generate a sentence, and the model's predictions improve with each step.

##Conclusion:

In this blog post, we've explored the process of creating a word prediction model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes a seed word or phrase and predicts the next word based on the context of the input. This technology has numerous applications, from auto-suggest features to chatbots and more.

As the field of natural language processing continues to evolve, word prediction models like the one we've built here play a crucial role in improving user experiences and automating various aspects of language understanding. Whether you're a developer or a data scientist, understanding the mechanics of such models can be a valuable skill in your toolkit.

Feel free to experiment with the code and datasets to build your own word prediction models for different applications. The possibilities are endless, and the world of natural language processing is full of exciting challenges and opportunities.
